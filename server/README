# Explanation of Dockerfile

This Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment with a simple workflow to build a React application.

### 1. FROM node:alpine

- This line specifies the base image for our Docker container, which is `node:alpine`. 
- Alpine Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution, and `node:alpine` provides a minimal Node.js environment.

### 2. WORKDIR /app

- Sets the working directory inside the Docker container to `/app`.
- This directory will be used for all subsequent commands.

### 3. COPY package.json .

- Copies the `package.json` file from the host machine to the current directory (`/app`) inside the Docker container.
- This step is done separately to leverage Docker's caching mechanism. It ensures that the dependencies are only reinstalled if the `package.json` file changes.

### 4. RUN npm install

- Installs the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- This command is executed inside the Docker container.

### 5. COPY . .

- Copies all files from the host machine's current directory to the current directory (`/app`) inside the Docker container.
- This includes source code, configuration files, and any other assets required for the application.

### 6. EXPOSE 8000

- Informs Docker that the container listens on port 3000.
- This line does not actually publish the port. It's a form of documentation to indicate which port the service within the container listens on.

### 7. CMD ["npm", "start"]

- Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
- In this case, it runs `npm start`, assuming that the `start` script is defined in `package.json`.
- This command starts the React application.
